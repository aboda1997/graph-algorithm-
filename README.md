Implement a Monte Carlo simulation that calculates the average shortest path in a
 
 graph. The graph  generated using a pseudo-random number generator to 
 
 produce edges and their costs. The shortest path algorithm will be Dijkstra’s.
 
 ##########################

 the implementation of a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm for a weighted 
  
  undirected graph (Graph). A spanning tree for a Graph g is a tree that reaches 
  
  all the nodes of the graph. The cost for such a spanning tree is the sum of all 
  
  the edge costs (weights) in the spanning tree’s edge set. Over all possible 
  
  spanning trees, the MST is the one with the least total cost (it may not be 
  
  unique).
